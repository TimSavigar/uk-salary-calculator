    <h1>UK Salary & Tax Calculator</h1>
    <p>Enter your annual gross salary to estimate your take‑home pay after income tax and National Insurance. Our calculator uses current UK tax bands and allowances to give you an idea of what you will take home each month.</p>

        <input type="number" id="grossSalary" min="0" step="100" placeholder="e.g. 35000" required>

    <h2>How UK income tax works</h2>
    <p>The UK tax system uses a personal allowance and progressive tax bands to determine how much tax you pay. For the 2024/25 tax year:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal allowance:</strong> The first £12,570 you earn is tax‑free.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic rate (20%):</strong> Applies to income between £12,571 and £50,270.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher rate (40%):</strong> Applies to income between £50,271 and £150,000.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional rate (45%):</strong> Applies to income over £150,000.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your National Insurance contributions are also deducted from your salary. Our calculator adds all of these elements together to provide a rough estimate of your take‑home pay. Always consult official HMRC resources or a tax professional for personalised advice.</p>

        <h2>Understanding UK Payroll and Tax System</h2>
        <p>The UK payroll system involves several components that determine your take-home pay. Understanding how gross pay becomes net pay helps you budget effectively and make informed financial decisions.</p>
        
        <h3>Gross vs. Net Pay</h3>
        <p><strong>Gross Pay:</strong> Your total salary before any deductions</p>
        <p><strong>Net Pay (Take-Home Pay):</strong> The amount you actually receive after all deductions</p>
        <p>The difference between gross and net pay consists of various taxes, National Insurance contributions, and potentially other deductions like pension contributions or student loan repayments.</p>

        <h3>UK Income Tax System</h3>
        <p>The UK operates a progressive tax system, meaning the more you earn, the higher percentage of tax you pay on additional income. This is designed to ensure those who can afford to pay more contribute more to public services.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Tax Bands for 2024/25 Tax Year:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Allowance:</strong> £0 - £12,570 (0% tax)</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Rate:</strong> £12,571 - £50,270 (20% tax)</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Rate:</strong> £50,271 - £125,140 (40% tax)</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Rate:</strong> £125,141+ (45% tax)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Important Notes:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tax bands may be reduced if you earn over £100,000 (personal allowance reduction)</li>
            <li>Scotland has different tax rates for some bands</li>
            <li>Tax rates and bands are reviewed annually in the Budget</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>National Insurance Contributions</h3>
        <p>National Insurance (NI) is a separate tax that funds state benefits including the State Pension, unemployment benefits, and the NHS. It's calculated differently from income tax and has its own thresholds.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Class 1 National Insurance (Employees):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Threshold:</strong> £12,570 per year (no NI on earnings below this)</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Rate:</strong> 12% on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Rate:</strong> 2% on earnings above £50,270</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>What NI Covers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>State Pension entitlement</li>
            <li>Unemployment benefits (Jobseeker's Allowance)</li>
            <li>Maternity and paternity benefits</li>
            <li>NHS funding</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Other Common Deductions</h3>
        <p><strong>Pension Contributions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Workplace pension schemes (auto-enrolment)</li>
            <li>Personal pension contributions</li>
            <li>May receive tax relief on contributions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Student Loan Repayments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plan 1: 9% on earnings above £22,015</li>
            <li>Plan 2: 9% on earnings above £27,295</li>
            <li>Plan 4: 9% on earnings above £31,395 (Scotland)</li>
            <li>Plan 5: 9% on earnings above £25,000 (new loans from 2023)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Other Deductions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Union membership fees</li>
            <li>Charitable donations (Gift Aid)</li>
            <li>Cycle to work schemes</li>
            <li>Childcare vouchers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Understanding Your Payslip</h3>
        <p>A typical UK payslip will show:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gross Pay:</strong> Your total earnings</li>
            <li><strong>Tax Deductions:</strong> Income tax and National Insurance</li>
            <li><strong>Other Deductions:</strong> Pension, student loans, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Pay:</strong> Amount transferred to your bank account</li>
            <li><strong>Year-to-Date Totals:</strong> Cumulative figures for the tax year</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tax Year and Important Dates</h3>
        <p>The UK tax year runs from 6 April to 5 April the following year. Key dates include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>6 April:</strong> Start of new tax year</li>

            <li><strong>5 April:</strong> End of tax year</li>
